# Script to create a Docker image using Ubuntu and latest AdoptOpenJDK  linux binary
# This script works in conjunction with jenkins plugins
# The script assumes that Jenkins has placesd the tar.gz of the binary
# in the root of the workspace. (WORKSPACE envar is set by jenkins)
#
# REPO defines the target docker repository for tagging images with
# ARCH defines the computer architecture tag to be used for docker image tags
# that are machine specific.
#
# This script builds the docker image but does not push to docker hub.
# The docker plugin could build the image but is not dynamically configurable
# so is only used to push the created image.
